# Lib

At first glance, this could appear to be a "miscellaneous" folder.

It's a place for functions that are re-used throughout the project, yet not 
re-usable enough to be pulled into their own NPM module.

They ideally should be pure functions have no dependencies on other things 
in the App folder.
